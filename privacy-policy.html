If you provide me with any such information, I may collect publicly available information from the social media websites you have indicated. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p><h2>When does Stanislav Bondar uses customer information from third parties?</h2><p>I receive some information from the third parties when you contact me. For example, when you submit your email address to me to show interest in becoming a Stanislav Bondar customer, I receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to Stanislav Bondar. I also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p><h2>Do I share the information I collect with third parties?</h2><p>I may share the information that I collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide my content or whose products or services I think may interest you. I may also share it with my current and future affiliated companies and business partners, and if I are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, I may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to my successors-in-interest.<br/><br/>I may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining my servers and the website, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the website. I will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for me and for you.<br/><br/>I may share portions of my log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the website. They may aggregate information about my advertising and what you see on the website and then provide auditing, research and reporting for me and my advertisers.<br/><br/>I may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in my sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect my rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</p><h2>Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</h2><p>Stanislav Bondar will collect personal information that you submit. I may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.</p><h2>How Do I Use Your Email Address?</h2><p>By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from me. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. I only send emails to people who have authorized me to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. I do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because I hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow me to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where I display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from me. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to me through another method, I may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, I include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p><h2>How Long Do I Keep Your Information?</h2><p>I keep your information only so long as I need it to provide services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that I share your information with and who carries out services on my behalf. When I no longer need to use your information and there is no need for me to keep it to comply with my legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from my systems or depersonalize it so that I can&#x27;t identify you.</p><h2>How Do I Protect Your Information?</h2><p>I implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. I offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into my Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. I cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Stanislav Bondar or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of my physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p><h2>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h2><p>Stanislav Bondar is incorporated in Ukraine. Information collected via my website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of my help services may be transferred from time to time to my offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p><h2>Is the information collected through the Stanislav Bondar Service secure?</h2><p>I take precautions to protect the security of your information. I have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while I use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure my compliance with that duty.</p><h2>Can I update or correct my information?</h2><p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information collects depend on your relationship with Stanislav Bondar. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in my internal company employment policies.<br/><br/>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact me in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on my systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that I maintain, or information that I have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, I may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<br/><br/>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to me from my system. The need to back up my systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for me to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases I actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.<br/><br/>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information I have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p><h2>Sale of Business</h2><p>I reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Stanislav Bondar or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of Stanislav Bondar or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that I discontinue my business or file a petition or have filed against me a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>Affiliates</h2><p>I may disclose information (including personal information) about you to my Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, &quot;Corporate Affiliate&quot; means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Stanislav Bondar, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that I provide to my Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>Governing Law</h2><p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Ukraine without regard to its conflict of laws provision. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to make claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.<br/><br/>The laws of Ukraine, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of the website. Your use of the website may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.<br/><br/>By using stabondar.com or contacting me directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with my website, or use my services. Continued use of the website, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.</p><h2>Your Consent</h2><p>We&#x27;ve updated my Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit my site and how it&#x27;s being used. By using my website, registering an account, or making a purchase, you hereby consent to my Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p><h2>Links to Other Websites</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Stanislav Bondar. I am not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by me. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, my Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on my platform, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect information about you.</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>Stanislav Bondar uses &quot;Cookies&quot; to identify the areas of my website that you have visited.

However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the website as I would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on my website correctly or at all.

You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g. saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your browser&#x27;s help menu for more information.</p><h2>Remarketing Services</h2><p>I use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the practice of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows your company to seem like they&#x27;re “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and platforms they use most.</p><h2>Third-Party Services</h2><p>I may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications and other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services (&quot;Third- Party Services&quot;).<br/><br/>You acknowledge and agree that Stanislav Bondar shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof. Stanislav Bondar does not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person or entity for any Third-Party Services.<br/><br/>Third-Party Services and links thereto are provided solely as a convenience to you and you access and use them entirely at your own risk and subject to such third parties&#x27; terms and conditions.</p><h2>Facebook Pixel</h2><p>Facebook pixel is an analytics tool that allows you to measure the effectiveness of your advertising by understanding the actions people take on your website. You can use the pixel to: Make sure your ads are shown to the right people. Facebook pixel may collect information from your device when you use the service. Facebook pixel collects information that is held in accordance with its Privacy Policy</p><h2>Tracking Technologies</h2><p>I use Cookies to enhance the performance and functionality of my website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the website as I would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously.</p><h2>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2><p>I may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of my Privacy Policy I are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how I maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p><h2>What is GDPR?</h2><p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents&#x27; data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.<br/><br/>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. my customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why I have implemented GDPR controls as my baseline standard for all my operations worldwide.</p><h2>What is personal data?</h2><p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p><h2>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</h2><ul role="list"><li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li><li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li><li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li><li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li></ul><h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2><p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals&#x27; personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it&#x27;s simply the right thing to do. At Stanislav Bondar I strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and I already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p><h2>Individual Data Subject&#x27;s Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h2><p>I are committed to helping my customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Stanislav Bondar processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. I do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, I dispose of all data in accordance with my Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but I will not hold it longer than 60 days.<br/><br/>I are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. I got you! We&#x27;ve been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. my customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p><h2>California Residents</h2><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires me to disclose categories of Personal Information I collect and how I use it, the categories of sources from whom I collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom I share it, which I have explained above.<br/><br/>I are also required to communicate information about rights California residents have under California law. You may exercise the following rights:</p><ul role="list"><li>Right to Know and Access.
